This file documents an I/Q server for the SDRplay.
For more information on the hardware, please refer to the web site:

    http://sdrplay.com

A server program, in the ghpsdr3 suite, is the program 
that forms the interface to the hardware.  One instance of this program 
must be running to allow the DSP process to communicate with the rtl-sdr hardware.

Currently the sdrplay-server program is a command line program and it has few options, as follows:
                                       
      -f [ --frequency ]  initial frequency in Hertz
      -s [ --samplerate ] samplerate in Samples/second
                          200000 | 300000 | 600000 |
                          1536000 | 5000000 | 6000000 |
                          7000000 | 8000000, def=1536000
      -g [ --gain ]       gain in dB or -1 for AGC (no AGC as yet)
      -h [ --help ]       print usage message
      -d [ --debug ]      debug level (default=0)

0.1 Credits and Acknowledgements
--------------------------------

The code base was derived (by Alex Lee 9V1AL et al.) from John Melton G0ORX/N6LYT code for HPSDR Ozymandias card.

The code specific for rtlsdr was written by Andrea Montefusco, IW0HDV (andrew att montefusco dott com).

The code specific for SDRplay was written by Roger E Critchlow Jr, AD5DZ (rec att elf dott org), with much help
from code examples provided by the SDRplay manufacturer, the gr-osmocom source, and the SoapySDRPlay sources.


0.2 Caveats
-----------

The code here described as to be regarded as highly experimental. Please reports bugs and suggestions on sdr-widget mailing list.

1. PREREQUISITE
===============

To build the server, you have to download and install the SDRplay API library from sdrplay.com.

2. RUN
======

We have to run three components: server, dsp processing and graphical user interface.
At the moment you need to run them in three separate terminal windows, strictly in the order shown below:

  xterm -e 'sdrplay-server' &
  xterm -e 'dspserver --lo 0' &
  QtRadio -s localhost &

That is if you are running the three pieces altogether in the same machine.
Otherwise use the IP address of the machine where the dspserver is running.

The sdrplay-server must decimate the incoming sample stream to 192000 SPS from hardware sample rates or it floods
the network interface and samples are lost.  The current decimation algorithm appears to introduce some crackling
artefacts as the hardware gain is increased.
