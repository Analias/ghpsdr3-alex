This is a Tcl/Tk script that behaves as a UI for the ghpsdr-alex3
dspserver backend.

This requires the following packages on Ubuntu 15.10 and later:

     tcl tk build-essential tcllib libpulse-dev

which may be installed with "sudo apt-get install" or any other
package management tool.  The tcl and tk packages may be installed
by default, the build-essential bundle of packages is often installed
by packages which require compilation.
