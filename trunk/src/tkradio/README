This is a Tcl/Tk script that behaves as a UI for the ghpsdr-alex3
dspserver backend.

This requires the following packages on Ubuntu 15.10 and later:

  $ sudo apt-get install tcl tk build-essential tcllib libpulse-dev

The tcl and tk packages may be installed by default, the
build-essential bundle of packages is often installed by packages
which require compilation.  If you have any other sound card programs
installed you probably already have libpulse-dev installed, too.

Given those packages, you should be able to build and install with:
      
  $ autoreconf -i && ./configure && make && sudo make install

At which point you can run tkradio as:

  $ tkradio

which will start up with the plain window (pw) user interface.
