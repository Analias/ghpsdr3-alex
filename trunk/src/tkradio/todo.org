[x] no tabs
[x] single globals ::channel ::radio ::verbose
[x] move dspserver enumeration definitions into sdr/commands.tcl
[x] teach automake to rebuild sdr/pkgIndex.tcl
[x] teach automake to install sdr/* into $(prefix)/share/tcltk/sdr
[x] start audio playback
[x] incorporate spectrum and waterfall 
[x] add s-meter
[x] figure out how to theme interface all in black and grey background,
	red or green or orange or white foreground
[x] theme, just in red, needs more work
[x] set up night vision theme
[x] wire up service -> band -> channels -> frequency / mode / filter
	cascade
[x] wire up mode -> filter  cascade
[x] socket can get closed while socket reader is running?
[x] crash when disconnecting, thought it was due to tcl-threads, turns
	out that even without tcl-threads there are threads, but did
	not crash under debugger.  Did crash in the debugger, finally,
	and downloaded debugging symbols.  It crashes in the pulse
	audio simple library, claiming a mutex that's been freed or
	something.
[x] Try to minimize exposure to pulse thread bugs.  Don't close and
	reopen?  What's a zero sample in aLaw format?
[x] Seems that my pa_simple.c didn't null its connection pointer when
	it closed it, runs much better when it doesn't access freed
	memory.  Still testing, but it fails much less often if it
	isn't fixed.
[x] Rob Frohne's hermes is generating spikes all over the spectrum which
	do not appear on QtRadio, don't understand how it fixes it.
	Botched the conversion from spectrum buffer bytes to dB.
[x] Implement sdrplay.
[x] is there more stalling because I'm not periodically polling?
	no, that doesn't appear to be the problem
[x] Get working connection status feedback.
[x] distribute new vertical space to waterfall
[x] track down the stalls on frequency change, apparently a major loss
	of event dispatching. Ah, sdrplay-server was synchronously changing
	frequency by restarting the sdrplay, missing many frames of spectrum
	updates.
[ ] make connection status feedback more useful
[ ] make sure sdrplay gain is effective when loaded.
[ ] Implement hermes.
[ ] Implement rtlsdr.
[ ] Implement hiqsdr.
[ ] Implement perseus.
[ ] Implement sdr1000.
[ ] Implement sdriq.
[ ] teach automake to clean up *~
[ ] add agc option menu
[ ] incorporate tool tips
[ ] add gain control panel
[ ] add dB to s-meter display
[ ] add dial or implement dialbook interface
[ ] theme tk menues?  menues come in standard color scheme.
[ ] theme tk entries?  entries come partly in standard color scheme.
[ ] theme checkbutton on/off markers.
[ ] why reduced noise from subrx?  in QtRadio?
[ ] why audio stalls without spectrum?
[ ] why clicking from sdrplay?
[ ] Scroll waterfall pixels when tuning, so they stay aligned with
	their previous traces.
[ ] Implement filters on input events to lessen the demands made on
	the hardware.  Some requests are easily done in dspserver with
	no impact on the hardware.
[ ] Implement the missing options in radio
[ ] Implement a gui for adjusting the missing options, a scrolling panel
	with collapsible groups.
[ ] Add back various decorations and labels on panel between spectrum
	and waterfall.
[ ] Identify frequency and level with tooltip on spectrum and waterfall.
[ ] Find the missing dspserver commands.
[ ] find the padding used on the frequency-display and apply it to the meter.
[ ] implement a full option database combining the dspserver commands that
	set just the option, the default value of the option, the limits on
	the values of the option, and the dspserver commands that include
	the option value.  And maybe a documentation string.
[ ] implement a self describing format for the hardware modules, so they
	can get an automatic gui?
