[x] no tabs
[x] single globals ::channel ::radio ::verbose
[x] move dspserver enumeration definitions into sdr/commands.tcl
[x] teach automake to rebuild sdr/pkgIndex.tcl
[x] teach automake to install sdr/* into $(prefix)/share/tcltk/sdr
[ ] teach automake to clean up *~
[ ] add agc option menu
[ ] add detailed configuration panel
[ ] incorporate tool tips
[x] start audio playback
[x] incorporate spectrum and waterfall 
[ ] add gain control panel
[x] add s-meter
[ ] add dB to s-meter display
[ ] add dial
[x] figure out how to theme interface all in black and grey background,
	red or green or orange or white foreground
[x] theme, just in red, needs more work
[x] set up night vision theme
[ ] theme tk menues?
[x] wire up service -> band -> channels -> frequency / mode / filter
	cascade
[x] wire up mode -> filter  cascade
[ ] why reduced noise from subrx?  in QtRadio?
[ ] why audio stalls without spectrum?
[x] socket can get closed while socket reader is running?
[x] crash when disconnecting, thought it was due to tcl-threads, turns
	out that even without tcl-threads there are threads, but did
	not crash under debugger.  Did crash in the debugger, finally,
	and downloaded debugging symbols.  It crashes in the pulse
	audio simple library, claiming a mutex that's been freed or
	something.
[x] Try to minimize exposure to pulse thread bugs.  Don't close and
	reopen?  What's a zero sample in aLaw format?
[x] Seems that my pa_simple.c didn't null its connection pointer when
	it closed it, runs much better when it doesn't access freed
	memory.  Still testing, but it fails much less often if it
	isn't fixed.
