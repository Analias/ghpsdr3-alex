The radio-backend scripts run a variety of backends for the
ghpsdr3-alex radio dspservers.

It depends on the expect package being installed to function.  Expect
is an extended version of Tcl which contains commands for managing
commands which require interaction.  This can be done on Ubuntu with
the command:

  sudo apt-get install expect

The configure for this directory simply checks if expect can be found,
the Makefile is not configured, it simply installs the script.
