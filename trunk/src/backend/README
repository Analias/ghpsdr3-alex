The radio-backend scripts run a variety of backends for the
ghpsdr3-alex radio dspservers.

A backend server consists of a dspserver process and one or two
processes to implement the hardware server.  Most hardware servers are
single programs, like rtlsdr-server or sdrplay-server.  But the
softrock backend can be configured to require a jack server to handle
the communication with the sound card.

The backend server is by default started in the foreground, so it
remains connected to the command line, or it can be backgrounded to
run as a daemon.  It can be run in a specified directory which
contains the pkey and cert files required for the dspserver ssl
transport.  It can be run remotely on another host.

The components of the backend server you want to start are specified
with the --jack, --hw, and --dsp options.  These take a string
containing the command required to start the component.

It depends on the expect package being installed to function.  Expect
is an extended version of Tcl which contains commands for managing
commands which require interaction.  This can be done on Ubuntu with
the command:

  sudo apt-get install expect

The configure for this directory simply checks if expect can be found,
the Makefile is configured to install the script in the expected bindir.
